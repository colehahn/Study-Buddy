# Contributions of individual team members:

## Goals from last week:
 * Cole: Learn how to use JavaFX, start a prototype application

 * Ahmet: Get familiar with JavaFX and start working on a basic app as a tutorial

 * Ilyas: Watch tutorials on JavaFX and other frontend tools. Our goal is to have a simple application with limited functionality.

 * Mekedes: Do research/learn about different timers that we can use for our project and then start developing a basic timer

 * Phuoc: Do research/learn about different timers that we can use for our project and then start developing a basic timer

## Progress and issues:

 * Cole: Learned the basics of JavaFX, set up the project using maven to import required things, and set up the file structure for the github repository. My biggest challenge was using maven, because I donâ€™t really know how it works, but it seems to be doing what we need it to.

 * Ahmet: I cloned the github repo, set up my IDE and got the basic app to run. I also familiarized myself with JavaFX and will continue doing that. I had an issue of JavaFX not working properly due to my laptop's processor but we managed to fix that by changing the version of Javafx from 13 to 17.

 * Ilyas: I set up my Intellij IDE, pulled the code from our new Git repository, and ran the simple application on my machine. I also watched videos on JavaFX and researched the different libraries available by them. I had an issue pulling code from our repository due to an issue with unstashed files. I ended up just re-cloning the repo from scratch.

 * Mekedes: Found good tutorials on basic timers, cloned github repository, and currently   trying to get the starter code to run on an IDE. I ran into some issues trying to open IntelliJ because I had to get a new license. So now I am going to try using VS code instead.

 * Phuoc: Cloned github repository and getting started on design documentation for timer and assignment tracker.

## Plan for next week:

 * Cole: Help plan interfaces between different parts of the project, look into making the app into an executable, and add buttons/different scenes to the ui.

 * Ahmet: Continue learning more of JavaFX, start coding different components in our app. Work on the design/architecture assignment with my team.

 * Ilyas: Work with my team to come up with a design/architecture for our project and continue researching JavaFX. 

 * Mekedes: Get starter code to run on my IDE, and start the design and documentation    for the timer and assignment tracker.

 * Phuoc: finish design documentation for timer and tracker.
