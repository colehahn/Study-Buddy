# Team report:

## Goals from last week:
  * Display assignments from AssignmentManager
  * Read/write assignments to file
  * Smooth out installation progress so it is easy
  

## Progress and issues:
* Connected the backend of the timer functionality to the front end. However, the start  timer does not restart the timer when it is in the middle of counting down.
* Added a pause/resume button to the timer scene
* Wrote user and developer documentation, added to repo
* Set maven project to produce a .exe file–need to figure out why this broke build
* Started tracking our bugs in the github issue tracker.
* Made the app an installable desktop app on windows machines (only).


## Plans and Goals:
  * Finish implementing core features and get as much reach goals as possible
  * Manage to save our app data in .csv files so data isn’t lost when the app is quit.
  * Make the timer make sound when it is done counting down, also allow users to set the  timer to their preferred time
* Try to make the app installable on all operating systems.




# Contributions of individual team members:

## Goals from last week:
   * Cole: Work with Ilyas on assignments page and FXML for easier layouts and designs. Make a menu method in App.java that creates the sidebar so we don’t have that code in two places. Make a css file with custom attributes to make styling easier.

  * Ahmet: Work on the pause button so it works. Also fix the issue that the timer doesn't reset when “start timer” is pressed. Also fix the issue that the initial timer label doesn’t adjust to the inputted time value. After all this, get to work on having the timer give a sound notification when complete. Then implement a button so the user can input themselves the time they want to study

  * Ilyas: Finish up importing the required library for fxml and then work with backend engineers to connect the UI to the AssignmentManager and AssignmentClass classes. Also, adding local files to save user assignments.



  * Mekedes:  DeHard-code the timer so that the user can enter a timer they want the timer to be set to. Fix the issue with the start button where it does not reset the timer to the beginning. Make the app be able to read and write assignments to a csv file when the add assignment button is pushed. Also create more better documentation and tests for the Countdown class.

  * Phuoc: Fix the issue with construction in Date and Time class. Finish up sorting the assignment function in the assignment manager class. I plan to work with frontend to connect the backend code with the UI.



## Progress and issues:

 * Cole: I made it so that the installer actually works and is updated on github automatically. I also started working with Ilyas on the assignments page so that it is better organized and we only have assignment buttons as we need them.

 * Ahmet: I implemented the pause/resume button’s functionality and got it working. I also improved the timer so that on initialization and reset, the label displays the correct value. In addition, I fixed the “start timer” button so that it resets the timer to the original value when pressed.

 * Ilyas: I was able to add the necessary fxml files and used them to build the frontend Assignments page. I also worked with Cole to change our assignments page a little. I also added some of the button functionalities on the Assignments page.

 * Mekedes: I tried adding new tests to the test suite, such as tests that would check if exceptions are being thrown correctly, however, I encountered some issues (errors) that would not let me implement those tests. I did not get that much to do that much in terms of implementation this week because most of the backend functionality has been done. One issue I encountered this week was that my IDE said that I had to renew my license, so I had to troubleshoot that to get it fixed. Lastly, I did some research on how to write/read data to a csv file, and got started implementing the code that would do that.

 * Phuoc: Added more tests for Assignment class and fixed the issues with Date and Time class in Assignment by Calendar class.  

## Plan for next week:
 
  * Cole: Finish assignments page UI to allow adding assignments and marking them complete. Reorganize fxml files. Add documentation to code, and work on finishing user documentation.

  * Ahmet: Continue work on timer. Implement a sound notification for when the timer is completed, implement break timer, and implement a button for the user to pick their custom times. Then, after completing the core features, work on achieving the reach goals such as keeping track of time spent per assignment.

  * Ilyas: Finish adding functionalities to the Assignments page. We hope to get the adding assignments functionality working and also allowing users to mark assignments as done.

  * Mekedes: Add the code that will write and read data to a csv file. Also work with Ahmet to implement a sound notification when the timer is completed, implement the break timer, and a drop-down menu/ text box where users can enter the preferred time. Clean up my code by making it cleaner and more readable by adding better documentation.

  * Phuoc: Continue work on Assignment class and implement read and write function to csv file to store our data.
