# Team report:

## Goals from last week:
* Implement the ability to add, save, and complete assignments in AssignmentTracker

* Have a basic user interface that covers the minimum goals/functionality

* Have a functioning prototype by May 10th!!!


## Progress and issues:
* Functioning UI with separate scenes

* timer displays countdown

* assignments page exactly matches the layout of our original sketch

* Got our tests to run

* The Timer scene doesn't actually use the Timer class. Use some JavaFX magic instead.

* Read and write data to csv/xml file.

* Make the app an installable app.

* Use css to style the UI.


## Plans and Goals:
* Need to add more tests

* Connect Timer to backend properly

* Expand timer page and functionality (break timer, pause button)



# Contributions of individual team members:

## Goals from last week:
* Cole: Create a top-level hierarchy that allows for easily swapping between scenes, and create layouts for the individual pages so that they are at least reasonably layed out.

* Ahmet: Meet up with the other frontend developers and work together to get started on our UI, specifically developing separate scenes for the timer and assignments page. We also want to get a lot of progress on the timer page because that is what the backend developers are working on first. The plan is for us frontend devs to work together as we start our development and then we can branch off and do more work individually on smaller parts later on.

* Ilyas: I plan to meet with the other frontend developers this week to get started with the frontend of our app. We have an idea of how we want to make it look so we will work with JavaFX to get an assignment and timer page going.

* Mekedes: Get maven tests to be able to run on my machine. Fix the timer so that it shows the timer in minutes::seconds. Also connect the timer to the front end and work on the assignment manager class.

* Phuoc: Connect the timer and assignment class to the front end and work on the databases for the app.



## Progress and issues:

* Cole: Successfully managed scene-swapping logic for modularity, copied Ilyas’s navigation bar to the timer scene as well so that the app is more coherent. Added a simple logo to our app just for fun :)

* Ahmet: I managed to write code on the timer page to get the basic functionality, i.e. have a time showing and it is counting down. At first I tried to use the backend timer class from my team, but I ran into an issue: the backend timer class was just printing output to the console. I didn’t know how to implement it onto my frontend, so instead I made a temporary solution from an online example. I think I want to resolve this issue this week.

* Ilyas: I made an initial UI for the Assignments page in preparation for our beta release. The plan was to also include a functionality to add assignments. We fell short of this due to the limited time left before the beta release.

* Mekedes: Fixed the timer so that it prints the time in minutes::seconds format. Also, I got all the maven tests to run without any issues. I attempted to connect the backend functionality of the timer with the front end with Amhet, but it was unsuccessful as I was supposed to return a string instead.

* Phuoc: Implemented functionality for assignment class and assignment manager class. I tried to connect from backend to front end but there were issues about data type between frontend and backend. For now, Time and Date type only takes milliseconds for their constructor so I need to find a way to convert string from frontend to millisecond.

## Plan for next week:

* Cole: Work on documentation assignment with everybody. Set up a global CSS file to make it easier to change the look of our application. Figure out how to make an installer, preferably using a maven plugin, so that we can test how things will work once installed locally on someone’s computer. Should also add more tests for the UI.

* Ahmet: Meet with Mekedes and manage to connect the backend and frontend classes for the timer, add a pause timer feature, and work on the break timer.

* Ilyas: I plan to meet with the backend engineers to utilize their AssignmentManager and AssignmentClass to allow users to add assignments. The plan is to also include functionality to save user data in a local file so they can come back to the app and continue where they left off.

* Mekedes: Meet with Ahmet to connect the timer functionality to the UI of the timer. Will Also will work with Phuoc to implement the code that will write and save assignments to a csv file. For now we are thinking of putting that code into the AssignmentManager class.

* Phuoc: Meet with frontend engineers to complete the app functionality and implement the assignment manager function where users can see what the assignment due before a specific time.
