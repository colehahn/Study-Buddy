# Team report:

## Goals from last week:
* Timer functionality developed in the backend

* Develop user interface into separate scenes, and add buttons and other components

* Testing and CI assignment: make unit test folder and have github automatically run them


## Progress and issues:
* Question: On our schedule we have the milestone “Ability to read assignment data from file into Assignment objects”, do we need to worry about importing previously saved data to our program in order to complete our prototype? Or can this be done after the prototype?

* Timer functionality developed in the backend.

* For the UI, we managed to make two separate scenes for the timer and assignment tracker, and buttons to switch between them. We did run into an issue though, and that was when we attempted to create individual classes for the assignment page, timer page, and event handler page. At the moment the code is incorrect with errors, we weren’t able to figure out the proper way to pass events through different classes. That is something we will need to research and finish.

*  We set up the CI (Github Actions) and the testing suites (JUnit and TestFX) for our project.

* Adding JUnit tests to the test folder causes an error when we run the maven tests

## Plans and Goals:

* Implement the ability to add, save, and complete assignments in AssignmentTracker

* Have a basic user interface that covers the minimum goals/functionality

* Have a functioning prototype by May 10th!!!





# Contributions of individual team members:

## Goals from last week:
* Cole: Meet with frontend team to get serious progress on the UI. We will create two different scenes for the UI: one for timer, one for assignments. This will make it easier to split up the work between frontend developers, and we will each work on a specific page.

* Ahmet: Meet up with the other frontend developers and work together to get started on our UI, specifically developing separate scenes for the timer and assignments page. We also want to get a lot of progress on the timer page because that is what the backend developers are working on first. The plan is for us frontend devs to work together as we start our development and then we can branch off and do more work individually on smaller parts later on.

* Ilyas: I plan to meet with the other frontend developers this week to get started with the frontend of our app. We have an idea of how we want to make it look so we will work with JavaFX to get an assignment and timer page going.

* Mekedes: Start working the part of our model by developing the basic functionality of the timer such as being able to set the timer at a certain time, with the other backend engineers.

* Phuoc: Start working the part of our model by developing the basic functionality of the application such as timer and assignment tracker with the other backend engineers.



## Progress and issues:

* Cole: Met with frontend, got a substantial amount of work done on the UI. Since we have more code now it is easier to be able to work on different parts. Also set up Maven so that it runs our tests automatically, and GitHub actions to trigger the Maven build.

* Ahmet: I, along with the other front-end members, worked on the UI and got two separate scenes with buttons to switch between them. Like described above, we weren’t able to make individual classes for them to work correctly yet. In addition, I briefly update our group’s working doc to reflect TA feedback, such as improving the risks section and team structure.

* Ilyas: This week, we worked on the front end of our app and we’re able to create separate scenes for the assignments and timer pages. I was having some trouble with GitHub and pushing changes to main. I also worked on the pros and cons of different CI/CD platforms.

* Mekedes: Developed basic timer functionality. The timer currently counts down from a specified time (in seconds) to 0. I also created an example JUnit test for it to set up the testing infrastructure for the timer. I resolved the issue I had with IntelliJ where the starter code would not run. But now I am running with another issue where the maven tests are not able to run the tests in the test folder.

* Phuoc: Implemented basic timer functionality and created the assignment class for assignment tracker with basic functionality such as add an assignment, edit an assignment, change estimate hours.

## Plan for next week:

* Cole: Create a top-level hierarchy that allows for easily swapping between scenes, and create layouts for the individual pages so that they are at least reasonably layed out.

* Ahmet: Develop code on the timer page to get the basic functionality, i.e. have a time showing and it is counting down. If possible, I will try to have a visual representation of a timer/clock that is counting down too.

* Ilyas: I plan to work with the other front end engineers to complete basic functionality for our app by next week. Specifically, I will be working on the assignments page UI.

* Mekedes: Get maven tests to be able to run on my machine. Fix the timer so that it shows the timer in minutes::seconds. Also connect the timer to the front end and work on the assignment manager class.

* Phuoc: Connect the timer and assignment class to the front end and work on the databases for the app.
