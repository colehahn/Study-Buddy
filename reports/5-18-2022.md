## Goals from last week:
* Need to add more tests
* Connect Timer to backend properly
* Expand timer page and functionality (break timer, pause button)


## Progress and issues:
* Connected the backend of the timer functionality to the front end. However, the start  timer does not restart the timer when it is in the middle of counting down.
* Added a pause/resume button to the timer scene
* Wrote user and developer documentation, added to repo
* Set maven project to produce a .exe file–need to figure out why this broke build
* Started tracking our bugs in the github issue tracker.


## Plans and Goals:
* display assignments from AssignmentManager
* read/write assignments to file
* smooth out installation progress so it is easy



# Contributions of individual team members:

## Goals from last week:
* Cole: Work on documentation assignment with everybody. Set up a global CSS file to make it easier to change the look of our application. Figure out how to make an installer, preferably using a maven plugin, so that we can test how things will work once installed locally on someone’s computer. Should also add more tests for the UI.

* Ahmet: Meet with Mekedes and manage to connect the backend and frontend classes for the timer, add a pause timer feature, and work on the break timer.

* Ilyas: I plan to meet with the backend engineers to utilize their AssignmentManager and AssignmentClass to allow users to add assignments. The plan is to also include functionality to save user data in a local file so they can come back to the app and continue where they left off.

* Mekedes: Meet with Ahmet to connect the timer functionality to the UI of the timer. Will Also will work with Phuoc to implement the code that will write and save assignments to a csv file. For now we are thinking of putting that code into the AssignmentManager class.

* Phuoc: Meet with frontend engineers to complete the app functionality and implement the assignment manager function where users can see what the assignment due before a specific time.



## Progress and issues:

* Cole: Added a new maven plugin that produces an executable file. This gave me lots of troubles, because it was difficult to figure out how to use different plugins. Eventually I found one plugin that combines the functionality of others to make it simpler.

* Ahmet: We managed to connect the backend and frontend for the timer. I did add a pause button but couldn’t get it working yet. That’s the next step, and if I have trouble, I can work with Mekedes on that.

* Ilyas: Worked with my other group members to complete the documentation on the app. I also worked to convert our Assignment UI into an fxml file so we can just upload this file instead of typing everything out in code. This requires importing a specific library and I had trouble uploading the dependencies needed for this. I ended up editing a file that shouldn’t be edited which caused the build to break. We rolled back these changes to a previous commit.

* Mekedes: Met with Ahmet and managed to connect the backend of the timer to the frontend successfully. However, the start button has a bug that does not reset the timer when it is in the middle of counting down. I also was not able to merge the backend branch to the main branch. Moreover,  Ahmet and I discussed how we should design some of the additional features that we would add to the timer.

* Phuoc: Added tests for Assignment class and tried to fix the construction issues with Date and Time class in Assignment. It does not take an integer as a parameter and I might need to change it to Calendar class.

## Plan for next week:

* Cole: Work with Ilyas on assignments page and FXML for easier layouts and designs. Make a menu method in App.java that creates the sidebar so we don’t have that code in two places. Make a css file with custom attributes to make styling easier.

* Ahmet: Work on the pause button so it works. Also fix the issue that the timer doesn't reset when “start timer” is pressed. Also fix the issue that the initial timer label doesn’t adjust to the inputted time value. After all this, get to work on having the timer give a sound notification when complete. Then implement a button so the user can input themselves the time they want to study

* Ilyas: Finish up importing the required library for fxml and then work with backend engineers to connect the UI to the AssignmentManager and AssignmentClass classes. Also, adding local files to save user assignments.



* Mekedes:  DeHard-code the timer so that the user can enter a timer they want the timer to be set to. Fix the issue with the start button where it does not reset the timer to the beginning. Make the app be able to read and write assignments to a csv file when the add assignment button is pushed. Also create more better documentation and tests for the Countdown class.



* Phuoc: Fix the issue with construction in Date and Time class. Finish up sorting the assignment function in the assignment manager class. I plan to work with frontend to connect the backend code with the UI.
