# Team report:

## Goals from last week:
  * Finish implementing core features and get as much reach goals as possible
  * Manage to save our app data in .csv files so data isn’t lost when the app is quit.
  * Make the timer make sound when it is done counting down, also allow users to set the  timer to their preferred time
* Try to make the app installable on all operating systems.
  

## Progress and issues:

  * assignments: 
    * validate user input/use a calendar drop down so that its easier to format input
    * added buttons and functionality to edit and save existing assignments
    * saved assignment data to local files, but had a tough time with maven dependencies so this isn’t in final version
  * timer:
    * implemented break timer
    * allowed for user customization of times via spinner objects
    * showed successful study cycles completed.
    * Timer makes sound when done counting down
  * worked on documentation, including readme, user manual, developer guide, and code comments
  


## Plans and Goals:
  * none?




# Contributions of individual team members:

## Goals from last week:
   * Cole: Finish assignments page UI to allow adding assignments and marking them complete. Reorganize fxml files. Add documentation to code, and work on finishing user documentation.

  * Ahmet: Continue work on timer. Implement a sound notification for when the timer is completed, implement break timer, and implement a button for the user to pick their custom times. Then, after completing the core features, work on achieving the reach goals such as keeping track of time spent per assignment.

  * Ilyas: Finish adding functionalities to the Assignments page. We hope to get the adding assignments functionality working and also allowing users to mark assignments as done.


  * Mekedes:  DeHard-code the timer so that the user can enter a timer they want the timer to be set to. Fix the issue with the start button where it does not reset the timer to the beginning. Make the app be able to read and write assignments to a csv file when the add assignment button is pushed. Also create more better documentation and tests for the Countdown class.

  * Phuoc: Fix the issue with construction in Date and Time class. Finish up sorting the assignment function in the assignment manager class. I plan to work with frontend to connect the backend code with the UI.



## Progress and issues:

 * Cole: I made it so that user input is easy to format correctly: added a calendar to pick due date, and made it so that times can only accept integers. Also made it so that assignments are editable, and the information shows an estimate of how complete the assignment is. I made it so that when the window resizes, the assignments page maintains a more reasonable layout. Also worked on documentation, tried to debug the maven dependency issue for saving data, and tried to make a mac installer that I couldn’t debug since I don’t have a mac.

 * Ahmet: I implemented the Timer’s break functionality, first with identical study and break times and then with differing times. I then added two “spinners” which allowed the user to customize the times they wanted, and this successfully altered the respective values in the code. Finally, on the last day I implemented the cycles completed feature of the timer. Didn’t have enough time for the timer page to show current assignments and let the user pick one to work on.

 * Ilyas: I worked on having assignments available on the timer page. I was able to get the assignments to show on the timer page but it was difficult updating the assignment information without refactoring the TimerScene class and the AssignmentClass class. So we elected to keep this feature out the final release

 * Mekedes: I implemented a notification sound that would go off after the timer is done counting down.I also added code that would write and read data to disk. But that had an issue with the maven dependency and I could not fix it in time for the final release.

 * Phuoc: I added the sorting function for AssignmentMangerClass to display the Assignment in order of due date. Then, I added a few tests for AssignmentClass to test on this function in testBefore() and testAfter(). 


## Plan for next week:
 
  * Cole: Reflection assignment

  * Ahmet: Finish the reflection then relax :)

  * Ilyas: Reflect on the progress we made during this quarter.

  * Mekedes: Reflect on the project and learning experience. 

  * Phuoc: Reflect on overall project and learning experience.
