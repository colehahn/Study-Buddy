# Team report:

## Goals from last week:
* Architecture and design

* Timer functionality

* Add some buttons/user interface to app

* Figure out how to make app installable for easy user experience


## Progress and issues:
* Question: data storage: 1) how will we store student’s data such as their different assignments, timer preferences, etc. 2) how will we secure the data so other apps can’t access it.

* completed architecture and design assignment

* planned high-level structure of application

* fell behind schedule this week, but have plans to get back on track


## Plans and Goals:
* Timer functionality developed in the backend

* Develop user interface into separate scenes, and add buttons and other components

* Testing and CI assignment: make unit test folder and have github automatically run them






# Contributions of individual team members:

## Goals from last week:
* Cole: Help plan interfaces between different parts of the project, look into making the app into an executable, and add buttons/different scenes to the ui.

* Ahmet: Continue learning more of JavaFX, start coding different components in our app. Work on the design/architecture assignment with my team.

* Ilyas: Work with my team to come up with a design/architecture for our project and continue researching JavaFX.

* Mekedes: Get starter code to run on my IDE, and start the design and documentation    for the timer and assignment tracker.

* Phuoc: finish design documentation for timer and tracker.


## Progress and issues:

* Cole: Worked on architecture and design projects, specifically on adjusting our schedule, adding new milestones to make it easier to split up work, and worked on the documentation section.

* Ahmet: Helped work on software design: designing different classes/objects and their layout. Didn’t start coding the UI or work with JavaFX which is disappointing but that is what is needed starting from this week.

* Ilyas: I helped my team complete the architecture and design for our project. More specifically, I was in charge of elaborating on one of our risks, communicating how the different components are interfaced, and weighed the pros and cons of different design decisions.

* Mekedes: Worked on the software design and architecture assignment with the team. I specifically worked more on the test section of the assignment. I didn’t get to start developing the timer, unfortunately because my group and I were more focused on getting the architecture and design of our project down first.

* Phuoc: Helped work on the software design and architecture part of the project.

## Plan for next week:

* Cole: Meet with frontend team to get serious progress on the UI. We will create two different scenes for the UI: one for timer, one for assignments. This will make it easier to split up the work between frontend developers, and we will each work on a specific page.

* Ahmet: Meet up with the other frontend developers and work together to get started on our UI, specifically developing separate scenes for the timer and assignments page. We also want to get a lot of progress on the timer page because that is what the backend developers are working on first. The plan is for us frontend devs to work together as we start our development and then we can branch off and do more work individually on smaller parts later on.

* Ilyas: I plan to meet with the other frontend developers this week to get started with the frontend of our app. We have an idea of how we want to make it look so we will work with JavaFX to get an assignment and timer page going.

* Mekedes: Start working the part of our model by developing the basic functionality of the timer such as being able to set the timer at a certain time, with the other backend engineers.

* Phuoc: Start working the part of our model by developing the basic functionality of the timer such as being able to set the timer at a certain time, with the other backend engineers.
