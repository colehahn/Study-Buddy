# Study-Buddy
Hi, welcome to Study Buddy! \
Study Buddy is a Windows application that helps users keep track of their time to work on 
homework assignments and tasks. The two core features are a study timer and an assignment
tracker. The study timer, inspired by the [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) 
method of studying, will allow the user to input how long they want their focus and break
times to be, and will continue alternating between those two times. The assignment tracker
will contain a list of all assignments that the student needs to complete, and the student
can keep track of their due dates and each taskâ€™s progress and estimated time to complete.

## Current Version
"Final Release": our application can be installed on a windows computer, users can input as many
assignments as they please, can edit those assignments and mark them as complete. They can also 
run the study timer with intervals of their choosing. When the timer is done, a sound will play 
to alert them, and the timer starts the break period.

Unfortunately, the app is completely unusable for practical purposes, because assignment data is not 
saved between sessions. Check in soon for updates on this...

## Future Versions
There is still so much that could go into this app! Some of the key features that we would like to see are:
* SAVE DATA TO FILE BETWEEN SESSIONS
* better connection between Timer and Assignments:
  * allow the user to pick what assignment they are working on from the timer page, and update their time
  spent on that assignment accordingly
  * add a "Start Studying" button to the assignment description that goes to the timer with that assignment selected
* create a Mac installer as well (this is nearly complete, we just need to figure out how to get around license and permission errors)
* make the Windows installer more friendly by having it tell you when it is done, and adding the option to create a desktop shortcut
* allow the users to sort assignments in a custom order, or on attributes other than due date


* ...and more? if you want to join the team and help make these changes or any other suggestions you
might have, please reach out and contact us, or feel free to make a pull request
