# Study-Buddy
Hi! Welcome to Study Buddy.
We will make an application that helps the user keep track of their time to work on homework assignments and tasks. The two core features are a study timer and an assignment tracker. The study timer, inspired by the pomodoro method of studying, will allow the user to input how long they want their focus and break times to be, and will continue alternating between those two times. The assignment/task tracker will contain a list of all assignments that the student needs to complete, and the student can keep track of their due dates and each taskâ€™s progress and estimated time to complete.

We have a folder containing all of the weekly progress reports.
